# Held native file effects — proposed integration contract

Status: implementation contract for review, not implemented or qualified. This
continues the full presentation startup requirement; it does not replace runtime,
loader, native/key, transport or physical qualification with a smaller feature.
Baseline: HMP1a49174; native reference ed1afb082eb3e46cf2edae9d8f68fb67b09ee4df.

## Integration and ownership

Extend the existing original startup IO lifecycle rather than create a second
arbitrary-file API. Cover all six captured operations: open/read/close/stat/fstat/
readlink. Bind the actual interpreter native_io allocation to the original scope,
activation, descriptor records, aggregate counters and source/cache/link context.
Obtain it through the original entry/source binding, never a later namespace
lookup, caller path/hash/error or qualified Boolean. Keep legacy configuration
reads distinct; they must not mint entry/native outcome or fallback authority.
No request, profile or HTTP client may select an operation or IO root.

Each admitted operation holds its original actor, current authority, fixed native
function, arguments and original result slot before the native call. Arguments
use exact primitive types and existing canonical relative-path/descriptor rules;
no foreign PathLike, coercion, equality or callback is admitted at this boundary.
Open flags and stat-result types come from the held native origin. Consume the
attempt before calling; no guard/refusal callback may erase or replace it.

Capture an actual returned result or raised boundary outcome before callbacks or
postcondition refusal. Preserve the held result when owner/slot/counter/authority
changes afterward. Bind native open returns to the original descriptor allocation;
retain exact read/readlink lengths and aggregate progress including EOF and
refusal overread. No copied result tuple, synthetic fault object or final payload
hash substitutes for the original effect history. Rejoin the original scope,
ledger and allocation after callbacks and before publication/current use.

## Refusal, cleanup and resource limits

A native-boundary exception is not proof of kernel entry: audit hooks and builtin
argument handling can raise before a syscall. Neither class/errno nor synthetic
fault injection proves kernel ENOENT/EACCES. Initially all failed or ambiguous
operations remain refusals. Do not add operational source fallback in this slice.

Cleanup retains the original fd/allocation and original context even after work
refusal; it may not revive work authority. Attempt close once, capture its actual
boundary return, and retain unknown debt after a lost acknowledgement. Numeric fd
reuse is not a second close of the same descriptor record. Do not retry unknown
open/read/close effects or clear foreign replacement state. Preserve actual known
byte progress separately from unknown additional kernel consumption.

Before implementation, specify aggregate attempt/result storage limits, returned
buffer ownership and exception/traceback lifetime. Do not retain unbounded read
payload copies or exception tracebacks. Existing128MiB/read-count/file/count/byte
limits cannot reset at the new owner boundary. Resource bounds are source
constraints, not operational CPU/RSS/deadline qualification.

## Required acceptance

Exercise actual temporary no-follow file/directory operations for all six calls,
primitive/type rejection with zero foreign calls, native substitution, wrong
thread/process and stale/revoked context before attempt consumption, original
slot/ledger/counter drift, real returns followed by lost acknowledgement, partial
read progress, EOF, descriptor-number reuse, close exactly once and retained
unknown debt. Distinguish synthetic pre-call faults from actual boundary returns
and from unproven kernel outcomes. No error grants fallback or code execution.

Cover original configuration/package/entry/runtime/cache/link callers separately;
source-only current/floor and complete affected regression are required, followed
by independent contract/security review. Do not alter live hosts, grants,
providers, devices or release state. The ongoing fixture/broad verification roots
remain frozen. Actual presentation-service admission and physical bot-image
rendering remain separate unfinished requirements.
